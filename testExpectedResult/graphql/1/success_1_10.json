Good leaders are willing to deal with all kinds of problems in a solutions­ oriented manner. They facilitate solving problems and don't dwell on problems, blame others for problems, or avoid problems.&nbsp; A good leader doesn't simply rehash a problem, or look for others to fault, or put off dealing with problem issues. A good leader facilitates getting&nbsp; problems out in the open for discussion and then helps the team find solutions and form action plans.</div>",
