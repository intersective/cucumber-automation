change the student name in the testAddTeam, testAppV1TeamAssessment, testAppV1TeamEvaluation and testAppV1CheckTeamAssesment

when it is required to run team assessment

for running the team assessment, we may run onlyAssessment for once to register another students and do an assessment
then we apply the student name on the above scripts

the reason of separating the add team and team assessement is that, making the test cases being self-contained is better
to organise the test cases
